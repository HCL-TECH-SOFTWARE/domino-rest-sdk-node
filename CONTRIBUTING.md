# Contributing Guidelines

## Contributor roles

Open source should not be just about writing code. A good open source project also needs:

- Documentation writers
- Testers
- Tutorial writers
- Evangelists
- Automation builders

If you want to get involved in a role (including ones we may have missed!) reach out to one of the committers.

## Working on issues

- Ensure there is a GitHub issue for any bug before submitting a PR.
- Enhancements should be discussed and a feature request issue created, before starting work on it.
- Fork and raise a PR for work.
- Add tests for any enhancements.
- Ensure documentation is updated accordingly, including adding unit test reports.
- Ensure API docs are updated (speak to an HCL-ite if required).
- Ensure changelog is updated.

## Development Environment

- Develop code with TypeScript
- Use Mocha and Chai for Testing
- Use JS doc in source code to document methods
- Use current NodeJS
- Favour build-ins over packages (e.g. fetch)

## PRs

- When ready, complete a PR and submit.
- Review the requirements for submitting a PR, for example writing test and updating documentation.
